# go-angular

Project using AngularJS + Go + RESTful API + MongoDB

This will be a task management application.

I will be doing simple step by step commits so you can easily see the evolution of the product.

## major libraries

### Server

- [Goji](https://github.com/zenazn/goji) - minimal web framework, net/http compatible
- [mgo](https://labix.org/mgo) - most advanced/fast/easy MongoDB driver

### Client

- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) - high productivity framework

### Database

- [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) - agile NoSQL

## road map

- base Go entry point and server
- GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- database integration (mongodb / mysql / embedded)
- simple authentication & security
- host it in Digital Ocean
- should be "curl-able" for now
- prototype design
- UI in AngularJS + Bootstrap
- responsive with touch-capability
- ...anything goes from here!
- profit ???
